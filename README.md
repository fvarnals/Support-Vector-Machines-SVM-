# Support Vector Machines

#### <em>'Using support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.'</em><br>
  
##### In the first half of this exercise, we used support vector machines with various example 2D datasets; experimenting with these datasets to gain an intuition of how SVMs work and how to use a Gaussian kernel with SVMs. 

##### In the second half of the exercise we used support vector machines to build a spam classifier.

Files that I had to write code to:<br>
<strong><em>gaussianKernel.m</em></strong> - Gaussian kernel for SVM<br>
<strong><em>dataset3Params.m</em></strong> - Parameters to use for Dataset 3<br>
<strong><em>processEmail.m</em></strong> - Email preprocessing<br>
<strong><em>emailFeatures.m</em></strong> - Feature extraction from emails<br>
